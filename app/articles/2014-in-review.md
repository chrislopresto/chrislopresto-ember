My New Year's resolution for 2014 was to leave the country. I love to travel in the US and abroad, but I so busied myself with work that I had not planned or set aside time for any long trips for a few years running. I declared 2014 the year to arrest this troubling (non-)travel trend.

### Canada

I was able to kill two birds with one stone on my first trip. I had a bunch of work to do with my buddy [Dave Liggat](https://liggat.org/) who lives in Montreal. So we picked a week for me to join his remote work setup from his apartment.

It was great to pair program in person on some of the trickier issues we were facing at [Plyfe](http://plyfe.com). There's no true substitute for being in the same room with your coworkers. That being said, at Plyfe we worked hard to provide a remote-friendly engineering culture. It was useful and fun to test our communication patterns from the Canadian perspective.

### Brazil

Summer ventured into bucket list territory. [Louise](http://louisegassman.com) secured tickets to a World Cup match in SÃ£o Paulo, where our buddy Will works as a US diplomat. We flew over to attend the Argentina Switzerland match in the Round of 16 and spend 10 days traipsing around the city in newly purchased [Havianas](http://us.havaianas.com/).

We watched the US men's team's heartbreaking loss to Belgium with friends in a bar, after which Louise swore off Belgian waffles for a year. We made more diplomat friends, including several from Canada. We went to a pretty fantastic [Coffee Lab](http://coffeelab.com.br/blog/). I bought red pants.

### Japan

In December, our friends Eric and Eric invited us to Japan, where they were performing in [Disney on Classic](http://www.harmonyjapan.com/doc/eng). We jumped at the opportunity, and Louise planned an action-packed two weeks.

Highlights included touring a traditional garden and the peace park in Hiroshima, eating steak and attending a light festival in Kyoto, hiking Mount Misen and touching the Torii gate in Miyajima, seeing Eric and Eric perform, and visiting Tokyo Disneyland.

### Otherwise

Aside from traveling, 2014 brought with it, in no particular order:

- New apartment
- New work situation (food for another blog post, or several)
- Becoming an uncle for the second time
- Nickel Creek at the Beacon Theater
- A couple's triathlon in Central Park with Manolo and Kate
- A brief Wakey! Wakey! tour
- Pixar in Concert from the New York Philharmonic
- David and Steve's wedding in California
- Dan and Nancy's wedding in Delaware
- Meeting Laura and Brian's baby Lee
- etc.

And that's that. Here's to 2015.
