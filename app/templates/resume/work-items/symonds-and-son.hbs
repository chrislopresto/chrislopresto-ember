<p>I spent a few months consulting for Symonds &amp Son, a Chicago-based development shop run by my friend Josh Symonds. I helped overhaul their Chef-based infrastructure and assisted on various client projects.</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span>JimmieJohnson.com received a complete design overhaul from Code and Theory. I implemented the new design and assisted with infrastructure upgrades.</span></li>
  <li><span>Symonds &amp; Son was building out new infrastructure and processes to support their burgeoning customer pipeline. I helped migrate to the latest patterns espoused by the Chef community.</span></li>
</ul>
