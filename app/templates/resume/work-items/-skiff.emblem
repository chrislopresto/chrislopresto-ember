p Skiff developed a very slick 11.5 inch e-reader as well as a content publishing system that delivered newspapers and magazines to devices wirelessly. The devices' large display size coupled with a proprietary ePub rendering engine enabled us to design content that evoked the look and feel of each publication. So the New York Times looked like the New York Times. The Washington Post looked like the Washington Post. etc.

p I led a team of 15 engineers and designers in New York that built an analytical template engine capable of automatically generating daily ePub newspapers. We ingested newspaper feeds (RSS, NewsML, etc.) each morning and analyzed the content to yield the best possible paginated layout on the fly. We developed a template control framework that powered image galleries, navigation, embedded content, tables of contents... all within ePubs.

p The Skiff e-reader garnered buzz at CES in January 2010 but sadly never saw the light of day. I purchased an iPad in April 2010. Skiff was acquired by News Corp in June 2010.
