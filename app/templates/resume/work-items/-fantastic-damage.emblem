p My buddy Oliver Delgado and I first collaborated in 2002 when my band needed a website. We began to take on web development projects and formed Fantastic Damage in 2003. At a time when most websites considered Flash intros (remember those?) a good idea, we developed aesthetically-pleasing web applications as well as a CMS that enabled customers to customize their own websites. This was a novel idea back then.

p We also developed a proprietary office system with real-time reporting data analysis for a mortgage company.
